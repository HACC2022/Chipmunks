Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.\n\nWhen you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a server. A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your computer.
